# Source files

This folder contains the main source files for the Server Writing Tools (for C) project.

The `makefile` is designed for writing a new project and not for building a dynamic or static library. It simply compiles all the files in the source folders and links them.

Edit `tryeme.c` to test out code using Server Writing Tools, if you wish, either copy the project and use it as a boiler plate, move all the files to your own project or compile a dynamic/static library (edit the makefile).
