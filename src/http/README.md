# HTTP extension for lib-server

This folder contains HTTP Protocol (HttpProtocol) extension for `lib-server`... However, although this project's makefile contains instructions for subfolder compilation... you might want to copy all the files to a single folder when incorporating these libraries in your own project.

The folder hierarchy in this project is for maintenance convenience only and probably shouldn't be used in actual projects.

## Demo code

Here's a simple "Hello World" using the Http extensions:

```c
// include location may vary according to your makefile and project hierarchy.
#include "http/http.h"


```
