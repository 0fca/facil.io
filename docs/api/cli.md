# Command Line Helper

This documentation is incomplete. I would love your help to finish it up. Until that time, please read the documentation in [the `fio_cli.h` header file](https://github.com/boazsegev/facil.io/blob/master/lib/facil/services/fio_cli.h).

## Overview

The `sock` linrary was born to solve [many concerns](sock_why) that pop up when using the system sockets API directly.

It supports TCP/IP sockets as well as unix doamin sockets. Pipes can also be attached to the library.

The `sock.h` API can be divided into a few different categories:

- General helper functions

- Accepting connections and opening new sockets.

- Sending and receiving data.

- Read/Write Hooks.
