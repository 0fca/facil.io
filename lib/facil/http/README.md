# The HTTP / Websocket extensions.

These are extensions that allow facil.io to easily implement HTTP and Websocket services. Please read the project's [README.md](../../README.md) for more details, or visit [facil.io's website](http://facil.io).

**Notice**: these extensions requires the core facil.io library (`fio.h` and `fio.c`) and it's `FIOBJ` soft type system.
