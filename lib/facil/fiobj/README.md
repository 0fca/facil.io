# The facil.io Object (FIOBJ) extension

This is a standalone facil.io extension for soft dynamic types.

To access the FIOBJ API, make sure all the files in this folder are accessible and include `fiobj.h` from your project.

The FIOBJ library can be used without the facil.io core library. To allow for this use-case, some code duplication occurs.
